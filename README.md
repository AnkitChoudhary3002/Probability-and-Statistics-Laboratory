About the Project

This project implements a fully logic-based random number function and statistical analysis system in C++.
All algorithms (random number generation, rounding, sorting, median, and mode calculation) are implemented from scratch without using any STL or external libraries.

The program uses a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) to generate uniform random numbers in a user-defined interval and then performs statistical operations purely through custom logic.

Key Features

Custom Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)

Generates uniform random numbers in the interval [a, b]

Rounds values to 3 decimal places using arithmetic logic

Manual Bubble Sort implementation

Median calculation (odd & even cases)

Mode calculation using linear scan

Array splitting and reverse-order display

No STL, No math/statistics libraries used

Technologies Used

C++

Basic I/O (iostream)

Core programming constructs (loops, arrays, conditionals)

Learning Outcomes

Understanding of pseudo-random number generation

Implementation of sorting algorithms

Hands-on practice with statistical concepts

Strengthening logic-building and algorithmic thinking
